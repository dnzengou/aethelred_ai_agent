        "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away.\n",

        "The skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them.\n",
