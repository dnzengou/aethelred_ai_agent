""
"The Art of War, literally The Laws of War (military methods) by Master Sun is"
"the most famous ancient Chinese treatise, dedicated to a military strategy and"
"policy, written by Sun Tzu."
"The treatise by Sun Tzu influenced crucially on a whole military art of the"
"East.  Although  it  is  the  first  treatise  on  the  military  art,  it  includes  clearly"
"expressed common principles of strategy as well as tactics. A special place in a"
"military theoretical literature belongs to comments on Sun Tzu, the earliest of"
"which appeared in the Han era (206-220 AD), and the new ones are still being"
"created..."
"The  Prince  is  a  16th-century  political  treatise  by  the  Italian  diplomat  and"
"political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli. From correspondence a version appears to"
"have  been  distributed  in  1513,  using  a  Latin  title,  De  Principatibus  (Of"
"Principalities). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five"
"years after Machiavelli’s death. This was done with the permission of the Medici"
"pope Clement VII, but «long before then, in fact since the first appearance of"
"The Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings»."
"The  Prince  is  sometimes  claimed  to  be  one  of  the  first  works  of  modern"
"philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is"
"taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict"
"with  the  dominant  Catholic  and  scholastic  doctrines  of  the  time  concerning"
"politics and ethics."

"I.  Laying  Plans"
"[Ts’ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese"
"for  the  title  of  this  chapter,  says  it  refers  to  the"
"deliberations in the temple selected by the general for"
"his temporary use, or as we should say, in his tent. See."
"§  26.]"
"1.  Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to"
"the State."
"2.  It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety"
"or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no"
"account be neglected."
"3.  The  art  of  war,  then,  is  governed  by  five  constant"
"factors,  to  be  taken  into  account  in  one’s  deliberations,"
"when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the"
"field."
"4.  These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth;"
"(4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline."
"[It appears from what follows that Sun Tzu means by"
"«Moral Law» a principle of harmony, not unlike the Tao"
"of Lao Tzu in its moral aspect. One might be tempted to"
"render  it  by  «morale,»  were  it  not  considered  as  an"
"attribute of the ruler in §  13.]"
"5, 6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete"
"accord  with  their  ruler,  so  that  they  will  follow  him"
"regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger."
"[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: «Without constant"
"practice,  the  officers  will  be  nervous  and  undecided"
"when  mustering  for  battle;  without  constant  practice,"
"the  general  will  be  wavering  and  irresolute  when  the"
"crisis is at hand.»]"
""
"7.  Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times"
"and seasons."
"[The  commentators,  I  think,  make  an  unnecessary"
"mystery  of  two  words  here.  Meng  Shih  refers  to  «the"
"hard and the soft, waxing and waning» of Heaven. Wang"
"Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant"
"is «the general economy of Heaven,» including the five"
"elements, the four seasons, wind and clouds, and other"
"phenomena.]"
"8.  Earth  comprises  distances,  great  and  small;  danger"
"and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances"
"of life and death."
"9.  The  Commander  stands  for  the  virtues  of  wisdom,"
"sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness."
"[The  five  cardinal  virtues  of  the  Chinese  are  (1)"
"humanity or benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3)"
"self-respect,  self-control,  or  «proper  feeling;»  (4)"
"wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here «wisdom» and"
"«sincerity» are put before «humanity or benevolence,»"
"and  the  two  military  virtues  of  «courage»  and"
"«strictness» substituted for «uprightness of mind» and"
"«self-respect, self-control, or ‘proper feeling.’»]"
"10.  By Method and discipline are to be understood the"
"marshaling  of  the  army  in  its  proper  subdivisions,  the"
"graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of"
"roads  by  which  supplies  may  reach  the  army,  and  the"
"control of military expenditure."
"11.  These five heads should be familiar to every general:"
"he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them"
"not will fail."
"12.  Therefore,  in  your  deliberations,  when  seeking  to"
"determine  the  military  conditions,  let  them  be  made  the"
""
"basis of a comparison, in this wise —"
"13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the"
"Moral law?"
"[I.e., «is in harmony with his subjects.» Cf. §  5.]"
"(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?"
"(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven"
"and Earth?"
"[See §  §  7, 8]"
"(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?"
"[Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts’ao Ts’ao"
"(A.D. 155–220), who was such a strict disciplinarian that"
"once,  in  accordance  with  his  own  severe  regulations"
"against injury to standing crops, he condemned himself"
"to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field"
"of  corn!  However,  in  lieu  of  losing  his  head,  he  was"
"persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off"
"his  hair.  Ts’ao  Ts’ao’s  own  comment  on  the  present"
"passage is characteristically curt: «when you lay down a"
"law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the"
"offender must be put to death.»]"
"(5) Which army is stronger?"
"[Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch’en puts"
"it,  freely  rendered,  «esprit  de  corps  and  ‘big"
"battalions.’»]"
"(6)  On  which  side  are  officers  and  men  more  highly"
"trained?"
"[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: «Without constant"
"practice,  the  officers  will  be  nervous  and  undecided"
""
"when  mustering  for  battle;  without  constant  practice,"
"the  general  will  be  wavering  and  irresolute  when  the"
"crisis is at hand.»]"
"(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in"
"reward and punishment?"
"[On which side is there the most absolute certainty"
"that  merit  will  be  properly  rewarded  and  misdeeds"
"summarily punished?]"
"14.  By  means  of  these  seven  considerations  I  can"
"forecast victory or defeat."
"15.  The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts"
"upon  it,  will  conquer  —  let  such  a  one  be  retained  in"
"command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor"
"acts  upon  it,  will  suffer  defeat  —  let  such  a  one  be"
"dismissed!"
"[The  form  of  this  paragraph  reminds  us  that  Sun"
"Tzu’s treatise was composed expressly for the benefit of"
"his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu State.]"
"16.  While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself"
"also  of  any  helpful  circumstances  over  and  beyond  the"
"ordinary rules."
"17.  According as circumstances are favorable, one should"
"modify one’s plans."
"[Sun Tzu, as a practical soldier, will have none of the"
"«bookish theoric.» He cautions us here not to pin our"
"faith to abstract principles; «for,» as Chang Yu puts it,"
"«while the main laws of strategy can be stated clearly"
"enough for the benefit of all and sundry, you must be"
"guided  by  the  actions  of  the  enemy  in  attempting  to"
"secure a favorable position in actual warfare.» On the"
"eve  of  the  battle  of  Waterloo,  Lord  Uxbridge,"
""
"commanding  the  cavalry,  went  to  the  Duke  of"
"Wellington  in  order  to  learn  what  his  plans  and"
"calculations  were  for  the  morrow,  because,  as  he"
"explained, he might suddenly find himself Commander-"
"in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a"
"critical  moment.  The  Duke  listened  quietly  and  then"
"said:  «Who  will  attack  the  first  tomorrow  —  I  or"
"Bonaparte?»  «Bonaparte,»  replied  Lord  Uxbridge."
"«Well,» continued the Duke, «Bonaparte has not given"
"me any idea of his projects; and as my plans will depend"
"upon his, how can you expect me to tell you what mine"
"are?»"
"[1]"
"]"
"18.  All warfare is based on deception."
"[The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be"
"admitted by every soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that"
"Wellington,  great  in  so  many  military  qualities,  was"
"especially distinguished by «the extraordinary skill with"
"which he concealed his movements and deceived both"
"friend and foe.»]"
"19.  Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;"
"when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are"
"near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;"
"when far away, we must make him believe we are near."
"20.  Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder,"
"and crush him."
"[All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, «When he"
"is in disorder, crush him.» It is more natural to suppose"
"that Sun Tzu is still illustrating the uses of deception in"
"war.]"
"21.  If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he"
"is in superior strength, evade him."
""
"22.  If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate"
"him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant."
"[Wang  Tzu,  quoted  by  Tu  Yu,  says  that  the  good"
"tactician plays with his adversary as a cat plays with a"
"mouse, first feigning weakness and immobility, and then"
"suddenly pouncing upon him.]"
"23.  If he is taking his ease, give him no rest."
"[This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch’en"
"has the note: «while we are taking our ease, wait for the"
"enemy to tire himself out.» The Yu Lan has «Lure him on"
"and tire him out.»]"
"If his forces are united, separate them."
"[Less plausible is the interpretation favored by most"
"of the commentators: «If sovereign and subject are in"
"accord, put division between them.»]"
"24.  Attack  him  where  he  is  unprepared,  appear  where"
"you are not expected."
"25.  These military devices, leading to victory, must not"
"be divulged beforehand."
"26.  Now  the  general  who  wins  a  battle  makes  many"
"calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought."
"[Chang  Yu  tells  us  that  in  ancient  times  it  was"
"customary for a temple to be set apart for the use of a"
"general who was about to take the field, in order that he"
"might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]"
"The  general  who  loses  a  battle  makes  but  few"
"calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to"
"victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no"
""
"calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I  can"
"foresee who is likely to win or lose."
""
"II.  Waging  War"
"[Ts’ao Kung has the note: «He who wishes to fight"
"must  first  count  the  cost,»  which  prepares  us  for  the"
"discovery that the subject of the chapter is not what we"
"might  expect  from  the  title,  but  is  primarily  a"
"consideration of ways and means.]"
"1.  Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are"
"in  the  field  a  thousand  swift  chariots,  as  many  heavy"
"chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers,"
"[The «swift chariots» were lightly built and, according"
"to Chang Yu, used for the attack; the «heavy chariots»"
"were heavier, and designed for purposes of defense. Li"
"Ch’uan, it is true, says that the latter were light, but this"
"seems  hardly  probable.  It  is  interesting  to  note  the"
"analogies between early Chinese warfare and that of the"
"Homeric Greeks. In each case, the war-chariot was the"
"important  factor,  forming  as  it  did  the  nucleus  round"
"which  was  grouped  a  certain  number  of  foot-soldiers."
"With regard to the numbers given here, we are informed"
"that each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen,"
"and  each  heavy  chariot  by  25  footmen,  so  that  the"
"whole  army  would  be  divided  up  into  a  thousand"
"battalions,  each  consisting  of  two  chariots  and  a"
"hundred men.]"
"with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li,"
"[2.78 modern li go to a mile. The length may have"
"varied slightly since Sun Tzu’s time.]"
"the  expenditure  at  home  and  at  the  front,  including"
"entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint,"
""
"and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total"
"of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of"
"raising an army of 100,000 men."
"2.  When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in"
"coming, then men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardor"
"will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust"
"your strength."
"3.  Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of"
"the State will not be equal to the strain."
"4.  Now,  when  your  weapons  are  dulled,  your  ardor"
"damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent,"
"other  chieftains  will  spring  up  to  take  advantage  of  your"
"extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert"
"the consequences that must ensue."
"5.  Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war,"
"cleverness  has  never  been  seen  associated  with  long"
"delays."
"[This  concise  and  difficult  sentence  is  not  well"
"explained by any of the commentators. Ts’ao Kung, Li"
"Ch’uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch’en have"
"notes  to  the  effect  that  a  general,  though  naturally"
"stupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force"
"of rapidity. Ho Shih says: «Haste may be stupid, but at"
"any rate it saves expenditure of energy and treasure;"
"protracted  operations  may  be  very  clever,  but  they"
"bring  calamity  in  their  train.»  Wang  Hsi  evades  the"
"difficulty  by  remarking:  «Lengthy  operations  mean  an"
"army  growing  old,  wealth  being  expended,  an  empty"
"exchequer  and  distress  among  the  people;  true"
"cleverness  insures  against  the  occurrence  of  such"
"calamities.» Chang Yu says: «So long as victory can be"
"attained,  stupid  haste  is  preferable  to  clever"
"dilatoriness.»  Now  Sun  Tzu  says  nothing  whatever,"
"except  possibly  by  implication,  about  ill-considered"
"haste  being  better  than  ingenious  but  lengthy"
""
"operations. What he does say is something much more"
"guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be"
"injudicious, tardiness can never be anything but foolish"
"—  if  only  because  it  means  impoverishment  to  the"
"nation. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzu,"
"the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably"
"occur to the mind. That general deliberately measured"
"the  endurance  of  Rome  against  that  of  Hannibals’s"
"isolated army, because it seemed to him that the latter"
"was  more  likely  to  suffer  from  a  long  campaign  in  a"
"strange country. But it is quite a moot question whether"
"his tactics would have proved successful in the long run."
"Their  reversal  it  is  true,  led  to  Cannae;  but  this  only"
"establishes a negative presumption in their favour.]"
"6.  There  is  no  instance  of  a  country  having  benefited"
"from prolonged warfare."
"7.  It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the"
"evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable"
"way of carrying it on."
"[That  is,  with  rapidity.  Only  one  who  knows  the"
"disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme"
"importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close. Only two"
"commentators seem to favor this interpretation, but it"
"fits  well  into  the  logic  of  the  context,  whereas  the"
"rendering,  «He  who  does  not  know  the  evils  of  war"
"cannot appreciate its benefits,» is distinctly pointless.]"
"8.  The  skillful  soldier  does  not  raise  a  second  levy,"
"neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice."
"[Once  war  is  declared,  he  will  not  waste  precious"
"time in waiting for reinforcements, nor will he return his"
"army back for fresh supplies, but crosses the enemy’s"
"frontier  without  delay.  This  may  seem  an  audacious"
""
"policy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from"
"Julius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time"
"— that is, being a little ahead of your opponent — has"
"counted  for  more  than  either  numerical  superiority  or"
"the nicest calculations with regard to commissariat.]"
"9.  Bring war material with you from home, but forage on"
"the  enemy.  Thus  the  army  will  have  food  enough  for  its"
"needs."
"[The Chinese word translated here as «war material»"
"literally means «things to be used», and is meant in the"
"widest  sense.  It  includes  all  the  impedimenta  of  an"
"army, apart from provisions.]"
"10.  Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be"
"maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to"
"maintain  an  army  at  a  distance  causes  the  people  to  be"
"impoverished."
"[The  beginning  of  this  sentence  does  not  balance"
"properly with the next, though obviously intended to do"
"so.  The  arrangement,  moreover,  is  so  awkward  that"
"I  cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text. It"
"never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an"
"emendation  may  be  necessary  for  the  sense,  and  we"
"get no help from them there. The Chinese words Sun"
"Tzu  used  to  indicate  the  cause  of  the  people’s"
"impoverishment clearly have reference to some system"
"by  which  the  husbandmen  sent  their  contributions  of"
"corn to the army direct. But why should it fall on them to"
"maintain an army in this way, except because the State"
"or Government is too poor to do so?]"
"11.  On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes"
"prices  to  go  up;  and  high  prices  cause  the  people’s"
""
"substance to be drained away."
"[Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has"
"left  its  own  territory.  Ts’ao  Kung  understands  it  of  an"
"army that has already crossed the frontier.]"
"12.  When their substance is drained away, the peasantry"
"will be afflicted by heavy exactions."
"13,  14.  With  this  loss  of  substance  and  exhaustion  of"
"strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and"
"three-tenths of their income will be dissipated;"
"[Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not"
"mulcted not of 3/10, but of 7/10, of their income. But"
"this is hardly to be extracted from our text. Ho Shih has"
"a characteristic tag: «The people being regarded as the"
"essential  part  of  the  State,  and  food  as  the  people’s"
"heaven,  is  it  not  right  that  those  in  authority  should"
"value and be careful of both?»]"
"while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out"
"horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears"
"and  shields,  protective  mantles,  draught-oxen  and  heavy"
"wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue."
"15.  Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on"
"the  enemy.  One  cartload  of  the  enemy’s  provisions  is"
"equivalent  to  twenty  of  one’s  own,  and  likewise  a  single"
"picul  of  his  provender  is  equivalent  to  twenty  from  one’s"
"own store."
"[Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the"
"process of transporting one cartload to the front. A picul"
"is  a  unit  of  measure  equal  to  133.3  pounds  (65.5"
"kilograms).]"
"16.  Now  in  order  to  kill  the  enemy,  our  men  must  be"
"roused  to  anger;  that  there  may  be  advantage  from"
""
"defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards."
"[Tu  Mu  says:  «Rewards  are  necessary  in  order  to"
"make  the  soldiers  see  the  advantage  of  beating  the"
"enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from the enemy,"
"they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may"
"have a keen desire to fight, each on his own account.»]"
"17.  Therefore  in  chariot  fighting,  when  ten  or  more"
"chariots have  been  taken,  those  should be  rewarded  who"
"took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those"
"of  the  enemy,  and  the  chariots  mingled  and  used  in"
"conjunction  with  ours.  The  captured  soldiers  should  be"
"kindly treated and kept."
"18.  This is called, using the conquered foe to augment"
"one’s own strength."
"19.  In  war,  then,  let  your  great  object  be  victory,  not"
"lengthy campaigns."
"[As Ho Shih remarks: «War is not a thing to be trifled"
"with.»  Sun  Tzu  here  reiterates  the  main  lesson  which"
"this chapter is intended to enforce.»]"
"20.  Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the"
"arbiter of the people’s fate, the man on whom it depends"
"whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril."
""
"III.  Attack  by  Stratagem"
"1.  Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing"
"of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to"
"shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to"
"recapture  an  army  entire  than  to  destroy  it,  to  capture  a"
"regiment,  a  detachment  or  a  company  entire  than  to"
"destroy them."
"[The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-"
"ma Fa, consisted nominally of 12500 men; according to"
"Ts’ao Kung, the equivalent of a regiment contained 500"
"men, the equivalent to a detachment consists from any"
"number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a"
"company contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two,"
"however, Chang Yu gives the exact figures of 100 and 5"
"respectively.]"
"2.  Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not"
"supreme  excellence;  supreme  excellence  consists  in"
"breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting."
"[Here  again,  no  modern  strategist  but  will  approve"
"the words of the old Chinese general. Moltke’s greatest"
"triumph,  the  capitulation  of  the  huge  French  army  at"
"Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]"
"3.  Thus  the  highest  form  of  generalship  is  to  balk  the"
"enemy’s plans;"
"[Perhaps the word «balk» falls short of expressing the"
"full  force  of  the  Chinese  word,  which  implies  not  an"
"attitude of defense, whereby one might be content to"
"foil the enemy’s stratagems one after another, but an"
"active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very"
""
"clearly in his note: «When the enemy has made a plan"
"of  attack  against  us,  we  must  anticipate  him  by"
"delivering our own attack first.»]"
"the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s"

"wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks, but this is"
"denied by Ch’en Hao. See supra II. 14. The name is also"
"applied  to  turrets  on  city  walls.  Of  the  «movable"
"shelters» we get a fairly clear description from several"
"commentators.  They  were  wooden  missile-proof"

"covered  over  with  raw  hides,  and  used  in  sieges  to"

"purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth. Tu"
"Mu adds that they are now called «wooden donkeys.»]"

"discover  the  weak  points  in  the  defense,  and  also  to"
"destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding"

"5.  The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch"
"his men to the assault like swarming ants,"
"[This  vivid  simile  of  Ts’ao  Kung  is  taken  from  the"
"spectacle  of  an  army  of  ants  climbing  a  wall.  The"
"meaning is that the general, losing patience at the long"
"delay,  may  make  a  premature  attempt  to  storm  the"
"place before his engines of war are ready.]"
"with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while"
"the  town  still  remains  untaken.  Such  are  the  disastrous"

"6.  Therefore  the  skillful  leader  subdues  the  enemy’s"

"laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without"
"lengthy operations in the field."
"[Chia  Lin  notes  that  he  only  overthrows  the"
"Government,  but  does  no  harm  to  individuals.  The"
"classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an"

"blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.»]"
"This is the method of attacking by stratagem."
"8.  It  is  the  rule  in  war,  if  our  forces  are  ten  to  the"
"enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;"
"[Straightway,  without  waiting  for  any  further"
"advantage.]"
"if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two."
"[Tu  Mu  takes  exception  to  the  saying;  and  at  first"
"sight,  indeed,  it  appears  to  violate  a  fundamental"
"principle of war. Ts’ao Kung, however, gives a clue to"
"Sun Tzu’s meaning: «Being two to the enemy’s one, we"
"may use one part of our army in the regular way, and"
"the  other  for  some  special  diversion.»  Chang  Yu  thus"
"further  elucidates  the  point:  «If  our  force  is  twice  as"
"numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up"
""
"into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and"
"one  to  fall  upon  his  rear;  if  he  replies  to  the  frontal"

"diversion.’  Tu  Mu  does  not  understand  that  dividing"
"one’s army is simply an irregular, just as concentrating"
"it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too hasty"
"in calling this a mistake.»]"
"9.  If equally matched, we can offer battle;"
"[Li Ch’uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following"
"paraphrase:  «If  attackers  and  attacked  are  equally"
"matched in strength, only the able general will fight.»]"
"if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;"
"[The  meaning,  «we  can  watch  the  enemy,»  is"
"certainly  a  great  improvement  on  the  above;  but"
"unfortunately  there  appears  to  be  no  very  good"
"authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the"
"saying only applies if the other factors are equal; a small"
"difference   in   numbers   is   often   more   than"
"counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline.]"
"if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him."
"10.  Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a"
"small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger"
"force."
"11.  Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the"
"bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if"
"the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak."
"[As  Li  Ch’uan  tersely  puts  it:  «Gap  indicates"
"deficiency; if the general’s ability is not perfect (i. e. if"
""
"he is not thoroughly versed in his profession), his army"
"will lack strength.»]"
"12.  There  are  three  ways  in  which  a  ruler  can  bring"
"misfortune upon his army —"
"13.  (1)  By  commanding  the  army  to  advance  or  to"
"retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is"
"called hobbling the army."
"[Li  Ch’uan  adds  the  comment:  «It  is  like  tying"
"together the legs of a thoroughbred, so that it is unable"
"to gallop.» One would naturally think of «the ruler» in"
"this passage as being at home, and trying to direct the"
"movements  of  his  army  from  a  distance.  But  the"
"commentators understand just the reverse, and quote"
"the  saying  of  T’ai  Kung:  «A  kingdom  should  not  be"
"governed from without, and army should not be directed"
"from  within.»  Of  course  it  is  true  that,  during  an"
"engagement, or when in close touch with the enemy,"
"the general should not be in the thick of his own troops,"
"but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he will be liable to"
"misjudge  the  position  as  a  whole,  and  give  wrong"
"orders.]"
"14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way"
"as  he  administers  a  kingdom,  being  ignorant  of  the"
"conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness"
"in the soldier’s minds."
"[Ts’ao Kung’s note is, freely translated: «The military"
"sphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can’t"
"handle  an  army  in  kid  gloves.»  And  Chang  Yu  says:"
"«Humanity  and  justice  are  the  principles  on  which  to"
"govern  a  state,  but  not  an  army;  opportunism  and"
"flexibility,  on  the  other  hand,  are  military  rather  than"
""
"civil virtues to assimilate the governing of an army»—to"
"that of a State, understood.]"
"15.  (3)  By  employing  the  officers  of  his  army  without"
"discrimination,"
"[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the"
"right place.]"
"through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation"
"to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers."
"[I follow Mei Yao-ch’en here. The other commentators"
"refer not to the ruler, as in §  §  13, 14, but to the officers"
"he employs. Thus Tu Yu says: «If a general is ignorant of"
"the principle of adaptability, he must not be entrusted"
"with a position of authority.» Tu Mu quotes: «The skillful"
"employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave"
"man,  the  covetous  man,  and  the  stupid  man.  For  the"
"wise man delights in establishing his merit, the brave"
"man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous"
"man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man"
"has no fear of death.»]"
"16.  But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble"
"is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply"
"bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away."
"17.  Thus we may know that there are five essentials for"
"victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when"
"not to fight."
"[Chang  Yu  says:  If  he  can  fight,  he  advances  and"
"takes the offensive; if he cannot fight, he retreats and"
"remains  on  the  defensive.  He  will  invariably  conquer"
"who knows whether it is right to take the offensive or"
"the defensive.]"
""
"(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior"
"and inferior forces."
"[This is not merely the general’s ability to estimate"
"numbers correctly, as Li Ch’uan and others make out."
"Chang Yu expounds the saying more satisfactorily: «By"
"applying the art of war, it is possible with a lesser force"
"to defeat a greater, and vice versa. The secret lies in an"
"eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip."
"Thus Wu Tzu says: ‘With a superior force, make for easy"
"ground;  with  an  inferior  one,  make  for  difficult"
"ground.’»]"
"(3)  He  will  win  whose  army  is  animated  by  the  same"
"spirit throughout all its ranks."
"(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the"
"enemy unprepared."
"(5)  He  will  win  who  has  military  capacity  and  is  not"
"interfered with by the sovereign."
"[Tu  Yu  quotes  Wang  Tzu  as  saying:  «It  is  the"
"sovereign’s  function  to  give  broad  instructions,  but  to"
"decide on battle it is the function of the general.» It is"
"needless to dilate on the military disasters which have"
"been caused by undue interference with operations in"
"the field on the part of the home government. Napoleon"
"undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary success to"
"the fact that he was not hampered by central authority.]"
"18.  Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know"
"yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If"
"you  know  yourself  but  not  the  enemy,  for  every  victory"
"gained you will also suffer a defeat."
"[Li Ch’uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch’in,"
"who in 383 A.D. marched with a vast army against the"
""
"Chin Emperor. When warned not to despise an enemy"
"who could command the services of such men as Hsieh"
"An and Huan Ch’ung, he boastfully replied: «I  have the"
"population of eight provinces at my back, infantry and"
"horsemen to the number of one million; why, they could"
"dam  up  the  Yangtsze  River  itself  by  merely  throwing"
"their  whips  into  the  stream.  What  danger  have  I  to"
"fear?»  Nevertheless,  his  forces  were  soon  after"
"disastrously routed at the Fei River, and he was obliged"
"to beat a hasty retreat.]"
"If  you  know  neither  the  enemy  nor  yourself,  you  will"
"succumb in every battle."
"[Chang Yu said: «Knowing the enemy enables you to"
"take  the  offensive,  knowing  yourself  enables  you  to"
"stand on the defensive.» He adds: «Attack is the secret"
"of  defense;  defense  is  the  planning  of  an  attack.»  It"
"would  be  hard  to  find  a  better  epitome  of  the  root-"
"principle of war.]"

"IV.  Tactical  Dispositions"
"[Ts’ao  Kung  explains  the  Chinese  meaning  of  the"
"words  for  the  title  of  this  chapter:  «marching  and"
"countermarching  on  the  part  of  the  two  armies  with  a"
"view to discovering each other’s condition.» Tu Mu says:"
"«It  is  through  the  dispositions  of  an  army  that  its"
"condition may be discovered. Conceal your dispositions,"
"and  your  condition  will  remain  secret,  which  leads  to"
"victory; show your dispositions, and your condition will"
"become  patent,  which  leads  to  defeat.»  Wang  Hsi"
"remarks that the good general can «secure success by"
"modifying his tactics to meet those of the enemy.»]"
"1.   Sun  Tzu  said:  The  good  fighters  of  old  first  put"
"themselves  beyond  the  possibility  of  defeat,  and  then"
"waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."
"2.  To  secure  ourselves  against  defeat  lies  in  our  own"
"hands,  but  the  opportunity  of  defeating  the  enemy  is"
"provided by the enemy himself."
"[That  is,  of  course,  by  a  mistake  on  the  enemy’s"
"part.]"
"3.  Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against"
"defeat,"
"[Chang  Yu  says  this  is  done,  «By  concealing  the"
"disposition  of  his  troops,  covering  up  his  tracks,  and"
"taking unremitting precautions.»]"
"but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy."
"4.  Hence  the  saying:  One  may know  how  to  conquer"
"without being able to do it."
""
"5.   Security  against  defeat  implies  defensive  tactics;"
"ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive."
"[I retain the sense found in a similar passage in §  §  1–"
"3,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  commentators  are  all"
"against  me.  The  meaning  they  give,  «He  who  cannot"
"conquer takes the defensive,» is plausible enough.]"
"6.   Standing  on  the  defensive  indicates  insufficient"
"strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength."
"7.  The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most"
"secret recesses of the earth;"
"[Literally,  «hides  under  the  ninth  earth,»  which  is  a"
"metaphor   indicating   the   utmost   secrecy   and"
"concealment,  so  that  the  enemy  may  not  know  his"
"whereabouts.»]"
"he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost"
"heights of heaven."
"[Another  metaphor,  implying  that  he  falls  on  his"
"adversary like a thunderbolt, against which there is no"
"time  to  prepare.  This  is  the  opinion  of  most  of  the"
"commentators.]"
"Thus  on  the  one  hand  we  have  ability  to  protect"
"ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete."
"8.  To  see  victory  only  when  it  is  within  the  ken  of  the"
"common herd is not the acme of excellence."
"[As Ts’ao Kung remarks, «the thing is to see the plant"
"before it has germinated,» to foresee the event before"
"the action has begun. Li Ch’uan alludes to the story of"
"Han Hsin who, when about to attack the vastly superior"
"army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city"
"of  Ch’eng-an,  said  to  his  officers:  «Gentlemen,  we  are"
